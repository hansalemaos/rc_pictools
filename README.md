## You might need to exclude the EXE file from being scanned in your antivirus program:

## Install by double-clicking

The first time you click on it, it copies itself to C:\ProgramData\RCTools and creates a file - pictools_uninstall.cmd
From this moment on, you can use the context menu to convert images to bw/gray/.ico

## Source coded included
If you don't want to download the exe file, you can compile the source code with nutika
